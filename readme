This project uses the NYC taxi trip duration dataset hosted on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data

The aim here is to predict the duration of taxi trips in NYC.

The preliminary plan is to build a baseline tree-based model using Xgboost.  
This will be followed by a neural network model based on structured deep learning techniques.

The neural net will be coded using PyTorch.
